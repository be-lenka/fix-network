# üõ† Network Fix Utility

This repository contains two PowerShell scripts to help Windows users quickly reset their network settings, such as renewing IP configuration and flushing DNS cache.

## üìÅ Files

### `Fix-Network.ps1`
- Requires **administrator privileges**.
- Performs the following:
  - Releases current IP address.
  - Renews IP address via DHCP.
  - Flushes DNS cache using both `ipconfig` and PowerShell native command.
- Includes elevation enforcement using `#requires -RunAsAdministrator`.

### `Fix-Network-NoAdmin.ps1`
- **Does not require admin rights.**
- Attempts to:
  - Release and renew IP address.
  - Flush DNS cache using `ipconfig`.
  - Gracefully handle permission-limited operations.
- Ideal for use by end-users without administrative access.
